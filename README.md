SkyRocket is a simple website for an IT firm that a lay person can access to get insights about the company. This project makes use of the flexbox framework to help ease aligning items on the page. Lots of utility classes are created that can be reused throughout the website. The lightbox library is used to be able to click on an image and scroll through them. The entire project has been made completely responsive with the help of media queries.
